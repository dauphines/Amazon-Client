# Amazon Client Service

This repo is a clone of Amazon.com's client service.  It is meant to replicate the handling of all major events generated by the client application while a user is buying a product, subscribing for a free trial of Amazon Prime, and unsubscribing from their free trial of Amazon Prime.

This service generates all application data needed to answer the question:

On a week by week basis, do users who spend more than $100 on products at the time of Prime membership signup convert to a full Prime membership more often than those who spend less than $100?

## Roadmap

The proejct's roadmap can be found [here](LINK_TO_DOC)

The Roadmap is broken into an overall App plan first, and then into individual service plans.  The service plan for this repo is referred to as "Client."
